# Myoelectric-Prosthesis-Hand
Undergraduate Final Year Project - 3D Printed Myoelectric Prosthesis Arm

The main aim of this project is to design a 3D printed prosthetic arm to perform digital forensic investigations with coexistence tools and advance methodology. Arm is built using Arduino, EMG electromyography electro nodes sensors and voice controlled using Amazon Alexa Ai speech recognition API through ESP 8600. Finally, data is extracted for the purpose of digital data investigation and accusation using AVR tools.
